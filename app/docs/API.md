# API: Overview

While Alchemy is a fantastic plug and play solution to graph visualization with many features out of the box, certain users will want to extend functionality or interact with the graph directly to create a more specific user experience.  For this reason, we've exposed a few API endpoints that will let you easily access nodes and edges, allowing you to use them in your application.

If you find that you are implementing a certain feature over and over using the API endpoints, we invite you to [fork the repo](http://github.com/GraphAlchemist/Alchemy) and submit a pull request with the feature so that most work can be done by Alchemy and its configuration.
