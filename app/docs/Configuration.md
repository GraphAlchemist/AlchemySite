## Configuration
<p></p>

Alchemy.js is initialized using the `alchemy.begin(your_config)` where the **your_config** object includes any of the configurations here that you would like to override.

The only configuration absolutely necessary is the [dataSource](#datasource) configuration.  See [Quick Start](#quick-start) or [Examples](#examples) for more examples of how to initialize Alchemy.js.

Additionally, configurations for any app are available at the alchemy.conf endpoint after the app has been initialized.
