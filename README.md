Alchemy Site
=======
## Quick Start
Alchemy uses [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) for scaffolding and work flow and [jekyll](http://www.jekyllrb.com/) to actually generate our documentation.

### Yeoman
```bash
git clone <this repo>
cd <this repo>/site

# Note, you MUST be in the site directory to run the following commands.
# Otherwise you will be running commands from the main alchemy app.

# install node modules
npm install
# install bower depedencies
bower install

#install jekyll, kramdown and code-ray (syntax-highlighting)
gem install jekyll code-ray kramdown

# fire up the develoment server
grunt serve
# package the site to go live
grunt
```


### Jekyll
All of the configurations for the jekyll reside in the `_config.yml` file and the build process can be run manually with `jekyll build`.

Jekyll ignores all coffeescript and scss files and lets the other grunt plugins take care of them. It compiles the index file from the .md files in the _documentation collection. The configuration.md file (one of the files in the documentation collection) is generated by the .md files located in _configDocs.
